Visualization of trained agents' action when given some used map (map used in training) and new map (map not used in training).
- Blue point: action, red point: optimal TX location.
- File name format: `{version}_{%m%d}_{%H%M}_{algo_name}_{used/new}_{sequence}.png` (`sequence` is used to distinguish different maps plotted at the same minute).
